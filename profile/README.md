# The COMPACT Collaboration

This is the official GitHub repository of the COMPACT (*C*ollaboration for *O*bservations, *M*odels and *P*redictions of *A*nomalies and *C*osmic *T*opology) Collaboration. The COMPACT Collaboration investigates the properties of cosmic topology and its observational signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the large-scale structure of the Universe. In addition, the COMPACT Collaboration explores the effects of non-trivial cosmic topology and its potential connection to unusual features in the CMB, colloquially known as CMB anomalies. For a broader overview of the current state of research in cosmic topology, see our recent publication: [Promise of Future Searches for Cosmic Topology](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.171501). For a more general discussion, see [Quanta Magazine: Cosmologists Try a New Way to Measure the Shape of the Universe](https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-try-a-new-way-to-measure-the-shape-of-the-universe-20250127/).


### Public Codes and Repositories: 

1. **[EOT_FDSearch](https://github.com/CompactCollaboration/EOT_FDSearch)**: a code for determining the fraction of points in a given fundamental domain (for orientable Euclidean topologies) in which the observers would detect matched circle pairs. Used to derive the results in [Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/01/030).
2. **[Topology Plots](https://github.com/CompactCollaboration/TopologyPlots)**: plots for the set of generators corresponding to each of the Euclidean topologies (E1-E18).
3. **Codes for temperature correlation matrixes**: codes for calculating temperature autocorrelation matrices and harmonic space realizations for orientable Euclidean topologies. **In progress**.
4. **Codes for spin-2 T,E,B correlation matrices**: codes for calculating T,E,B correlation matrices for orientable Euclidean topologies. **In progress**.
